### Naming Examples

**Good Examples** :

```bash
feature/jzhk/user-authentication-123
fix/ijs/login-timeout-456
documentation/smd/api-endpoints-789
style/jzhk/responsive-navbar-231
refactor/ijs/auth-service-321
data/jk/user-seed-data-111
test/jzhk/auth-unit-tests-654
chore/smd/upgrade-nextjs-987
cicd/smd/deploy-pipeline-432
performance/jzhk/image-optimization-999
devEx/jzhk/vscode-settings-342
revert/ijs/broken-commit-289
miscellaneous/smd/temporary-fix-752
```

**Bad Examples** :

```bash
❌ feature-user-auth           # Missing Username & Story ID
❌ jzhk/user-authentication    # Missing Tag
❌ feature/UserAuth/123        # Username Not Lowercase
❌ feature/jzhk/User Auth 123  # Spaces Not Allowed
❌ my-feature-branch           # Doesn't Follow Convention
❌ quick-fix                   # Doesn't Follow Convention
```

### Special Maintenance Branches

In addition to Regular Development Branches, the Boilerplate supports Special Maintenance Branches :

#### Backup Branches

**Format** : `backup/pre-[update]-[YYYYMMDD]`

**Purpose** : Create Immutable Snapshots Before Major Upgrades

**Examples** :

```bash
backup/pre-django5-20241226
backup/pre-nextjs16-20241220
backup/pre-postgres16-20250115
```

**Important** :

- Required Before Any Major Framework Upgrade
- Protected from Modification & Deletion
- No CI / CD Runs on Backup Branches

#### Upgrade Branches

**Format** : `chore/upgrade/[component]`

**Purpose** : Major Version Upgrades for Core Components

**Examples** :

```bash
chore/upgrade/backend     # Django, Python Upgrades
chore/upgrade/frontend    # NextJS, ReactJS Upgrades
chore/upgrade/mobile      # Expo, React Native Upgrades
chore/upgrade/database    # PostgreSQL Upgrades
```

**Special Requirements** :

- Must Create Backup Branch First
- Requires Enhanced Testing (2+ Days `devEnv`, 1+ Week `stagingEnv`)
- May Require Additional Approvals (Team-Dependent)

## Branch Protection Rules

This Boilerplate enforces Branch Protection through GitHub Rulesets to Maintain Code Quality & Enable Safe Collaboration.

### Configuration Philosophy

The Branch Protection Rules are designed to be :

- **Scalable** - Work for Solo Developers & Teams
- **Flexible** - Adjust based on Team Size & Risk Tolerance
- **Automated** - Leverage CI / CD for Quality Gates
- **Safe** - Prevent Accidental Damage to Critical Branches

### Protected Branches

#### 1. `main` Branch (Integration Branch)

**Ruleset** : `main-branch-protection`

**Default Requirements** :

- ✅ **Pull Request Required** - Direct Pushes Blocked
- ⚙️ **Approval Requirements** - Configurable (0 for Solo, 1+ for Teams)
- ✅ **Status Checks Must Pass** - All CI Tests Required
  - `backend-tests` - Django / FastAPI Tests (pytest, Linting)
  - `frontend-tests` - NextJS / ReactJS Tests (Jest, ESLint)
  - `mobile-tests` - Expo / React Native Tests
  - `docker-build` - Container Build Validation
  - `security-scan` - Trivy, `npm audit`, Safety Checks
- ✅ **Branch Must be Up-To-Date** - Rebase / Merge Required
- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked** - Prevents History Rewriting
- ✅ **Linear History Required** - Clean Commit History

**Team Size Recommendations** :

**Solo Developer** :

- Required Approvals : `0` (Owner can Merge After CI)
- Self-Review Encouraged But Not Enforced

**Small Team (2-5 Developers)** :

- Required Approvals : `1`
- Any Team Member can Approve

**Medium / Large Team (6+ Developers)** :

- Required Approvals : `2`
- Consider `CODEOWNERS.md` for Specialized Reviews

#### 2. Development Environment Branch (`devEnv`)

**Ruleset** : `devEnv-branch-protection`

**Requirements** :

- ✅ **Pull Request Required**
- ⚙️ **Approval Requirements** :
  - 0 Approval for Solo
  - 1+ Approvals for Team
- ✅ **Status Checks Must Pass**
- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked**
- ✅ **Deletion Restricted**

**What This Means?** :

- Development Environment Branch `devEnv` is the Deployment Target
- Changes Flow through : `main` → `devEnv`
- Protected from Accidental Deletion / Force Pushes
- Merges Allowed After CI Passes

#### 3. Staging / QA Environment Branch (`stagingEnv`)

**Ruleset** : `stagingEnv-branch-protection`

**Requirements** :

- ✅ **Pull Request Required**
- ⚙️ **Approval Requirements** :
  - 0 Approval for Solo
  - 1 Approval for QA / Team Lead
- ✅ **Status Checks Must Pass**
- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked**
- ✅ **Deletion Restricted**

**What This Means?** :

- Staging Environment Branch `stagingEnv` is the Deployment Target
- Changes Flow through : `main` → `devEnv` → `stagingEnv`
- Protected from Accidental Deletion / Force Pushes
- Merges Allowed After CI Passes

#### 4. Production Environment Branch (`prodEnv`)

**Ruleset** : `prodEnv-branch-protection`

**Requirements** :

- ✅ **Pull Request Required**
- ⚙️ **Approval Requirements** :
  - 0 Approval for Solo
  - 1-2 Approvals (Maintainers Only)
- ✅ **Status Checks Must Pass**
- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked**
- ✅ **Deletion Restricted**

**What This Means?** :

- Production Environment Branch `prodEnv` is the Deployment Target
- Changes Flow through : `main` → `devEnv` → `stagingEnv` → `prodEnv`
- Protected from Accidental Deletion / Force Pushes
- Production requires Highest Scrutiny

#### 3. Backup Branches (`backup/**`)

**Ruleset** : `backup-branches-protection`

**Requirements** :

- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked** - Immutable Snapshots
- ✅ **Deletion Restricted** - Permanent Preservation
- ✅ **Linear History Required** - Clean History
- ❌ **No PRs Required** - Created Directly from `main`
- ❌ **No Status Checks** - Snapshots, Not Active Development

**Purpose** :

- Provides Rollback Points for Major Upgrades
- Preserves Known-Good States
- Cannot be Modified After Creation

#### 4. Upgrade Branches (`chore/upgrade/**`)

**Ruleset** : `upgrade-branches-protection`

**Requirements** :

- ✅ **Pull Request Required**
- ⚙️ **Enhanced Approval Requirements** - 1 - 2+ Approvals Recommended
- ✅ **All Status Checks Must Pass**
- ✅ **Upgrade Validation Check** - Verifies Backup Exists
- ✅ **Force Pushes Blocked**

**Special CI Validation** :

- Automatically Checks that Corresponding Backup Branch Exists
- Fails CI if Backup is Missing
- ⚠️ Warns about Major Version Changes

### Configuring for Your Team

**When Scaffolding A New Project, Adjust Protection based on Team Size** :

**Solo Project** :

```yaml
main: 0 Approval Required (Self-Review Encouraged)
devEnv: 0 Approval (Self-Review Encouraged)
stagingEnv: 0 Approval (Self-Review Encouraged)
prodEnv: 0 Approval (Self-Review Encouraged)
```

**Small Team (2-5)** :

```yaml
main: 1 Approval Required
devEnv: 0 Approval
stagingEnv: 1 Approval
prodEnv: 1 Approval
```

**Medium Team (6-15)** :

```yaml
main: 1-2 Approvals Required
devEnv: 0 Approval
stagingEnv: 1 Approval (QA Lead)
prodEnv: 2 Approvals (Maintainers)
```

**Large Team (15+)** :

```yaml
main: 2 Approvals Required
devEnv: 1 Approval
stagingEnv: 2 Approvals
prodEnv: 2-3 Approvals (CODEOWNERS Enforced)
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Ensure Branch Naming is Correct** :

   ```bash
   # Check Your Current Branch
   git branch --show-current

   # Should Match : [tag]/[username]/[story-id]
   # Example : feature/jzhk/user-auth-123
   ```

2. **Sync with `main`** :

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main  # Or git merge main
   ```

3. **Run Tests Locally** :

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   pytest --cov
   black . && flake8 && isort .

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Review Your Changes** :
   ```bash
   git diff main
   git log main..HEAD
   ```

### Creating the PR

1. **Push Your Branch** :

   ```bash
   git push origin [tag]/[username]/[story-id]
   ```

2. **Create PR via GitHub UI** / CLI :

   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head [tag]/[username]/[story-id]
   ```

3. **Fill out PR Template Completely** :
   - Clear Title Describing the Change
   - Reference to Issue / Story Number
   - Description of Changes Made
   - Testing Performed
   - Screenshots (For UI Changes)
   - Breaking Changes (If Any)
   - Checklist Completion

4. **Request Reviewers** (If Team) :
   - Tag Appropriate Team Members
   - Use `CODEOWNERS.md` If Configured
   - Notify in Team Channel

### PR Review Checklist

**Automated Checks (CI will Verify)** :

- ✅ Branch Naming follows Convention
- ✅ All Tests Pass (`backend`, `frontend`, `mobile`)
- ✅ Code Coverage meets Thresholds (80%+)
- ✅ No Linting Errors
- ✅ TypeScript Type Checks Pass
- ✅ Docker Images Build Successfully
- ✅ No Security Vulnerabilities
- ✅ Upgrade Validation (If `upgrade` Branch)

**Human Reviewers should Check** :

- Code Quality & Maintainability
- Architecture & Design Patterns
- Test Coverage Adequacy
- Documentation Completeness
- Breaking Changes Clearly Communicated
- Migration Path for Upgrades
- Performance Implications
- Security Considerations

### Addressing Review Feedback

1. **Make Requested Changes:**

   ```bash
   # Make Changes Locally
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix : Addressed Review Feedback"
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

2. **CI Runs Automatically** on New Pushes

3. **Re-Request Review** After Major Changes

4. **Resolve Conversations** in GitHub UI

### Merge Strategies

Choose the Appropriate Merge Strategy :

**`Squash and Merge`** (Recommended for Most Cases)

- Combines All Commits into One
- Keeps `main` History Clean & Linear
- Used for : `feature/_`, `fix/_`, `style/_`, `documentation/_`

```bash
# Results in One commit on "main" Branch :
feature : Added User Authentication (#123)
```

**`Rebase and Merge`** (For Specific Cases)

- Preserves Individual Commits
- Maintains Detailed Commit History
- Used for : Complex Features with Logical Commit Breakdown

```bash
# Preserves All Commits :
feature : Added User Model
feature : Added Authentication Service
feature : Added Login Endpoint
test : Added Authentication Tests
```

**Never Use "`Create a merge commit`"**

- Violates Linear History Requirement
- Creates Unnecessary Merge Commits
- Blocked by Branch Protection

### After Merging

1. **Delete the Created Branch** :

   ```bash
   git branch -d [tag]/[username]/[story-id]
   git push origin --delete [tag]/[username]/[story-id]
   ```

   Or Use GitHub's "Delete branch" Button (Recommended)

2. **Monitor CI / CD Deployment** :
   - Check GitHub Actions for Deployment Status
   - Verify Deployment to `devEnv`
   - Watch for Any Deployment Errors

3. **Verify Changes** :

   ```bash
   # Pull Latest "main"
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Test Locally If Needed
   ./scripts/dev-start.sh
   ```

4. **Update Documentation** If Needed

5. **Close Related Issues / Stories**

## Special Branches

### Working with Backup Branches

Backup Branches are **Critical** for Safe Major Upgrades. They provide Rollback Points if something goes wrong.

#### When to Create Backup Branches

Create a Backup Branch Before :

- ✅ Major Framework Upgrades (Django 5.1 → 5.2)
- ✅ Major Dependency Updates (NextJS 15 → 16)
- ✅ Database Engine Upgrades (PostgreSQL 15 → 16)
- ✅ Breaking API Changes
- ✅ Major Refactoring Efforts
- ✅ Significant Architecture Changes

#### How to Create Backup Branches

```bash
# 1. Ensure "main" Branch is Clean & Up-To-Date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify Everything Works
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# Test Critical Functionality

# 3. Create Backup Branch
git checkout -b backup/pre-django5-20241226

# 4. Push Immediately (No Changes)
git push origin backup/pre-django5-20241226
```

**Important Notes** :

- Backup Branches are Created from `main` with **Zero Changes**
- They are immediately Protected (No Modifications Allowed)
- Never Delete `backup` Branches
- Keep Indefinitely / Until EOL of Old Version

#### Using Backup Branches for Rollback

If An Upgrade Fails :

```bash
# 1. Create Rollback Branch from Backup
git checkout backup/pre-django5-20241226
git checkout -b fix/jzhk/rollback-django5-999

# 2. Cherry-Pick Any Needed Commits
git cherry-pick

# 3. Create PR to "main" Branch
git push origin fix/jzhk/rollback-django5-999

# 4. Merge & Deploy
```

### Working with Upgrade Branches

### Examples

**Simple Feature** :

```bash
git commit -m "feature : Added User Authentication"
```

**Feature with Scope** :

```bash
git commit -m "feature (auth) : Added JWT Token Validation"
```

**Bug Fix with Body** :

```bash
git commit -m "fix (login) : Resolved Timeout on Slow Connections

Users were Experiencing Timeouts during Login when on Slow Networks. Increased Timeout from 5 Seconds to 15 Seconds & Added Retry
Logic with Exponential Backoff.

Fixed : Issue #456"
```

**Breaking Change** :

```bash
git commit -m "feature (api) : Redesigned Authentication Endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE : Authentication now uses JWT Tokens instead of Session Cookies. Clients Must Update to Use Bearer Token Authentication.

Migration Guide : 'documentation/migration/v2-auth.md'
Affects : All API Clients
Old Endpoint : POST /api/auth/login
New Endpoint : POST /api/v2/auth/token

Reference Issue : #789"
```

**Upgrade Commit** :

```bash
git commit -m "chore (deps) : Upgraded Django 5.1 → 5.2

- Updated 'requirements.txt'
- Fixed Deprecated Settings
- Updated Middleware Configuration
- Fixed Authentication Backend
- Updated Tests

Breaking Changes :
- MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES → MIDDLEWARE
- Python 3.12+ Required

Backup : 'backup/pre-django5-20241226'
Reference Issue : #123"
```

**Multiple Changes** :

```bash
git commit -m "chore : Updated Development Dependencies

- Upgraded pytest 8.3 → 8.4
- Upgraded black 24.8 → 25.9
- Upgraded eslint 8.57 → 9.0
- Fixed New Linting Issues
- Updated CI Configuration

All Tests Passing Locally."
```

### Commit Best Practices

**✅ DOs** :

- ✅ Use Past Tense ("Added Feature" not "Add Feature")
- ✅ Use space before & after ':' between Tag Name & Description (feature : Added Authentication)
- ✅ Use Title Case for Main Words (feature : Added Login Endpoint)
- ✅ Use Imperative Mood (OK ✅ "Moved Cursor to ..." Not ❌ "Moves Cursor to ...")
- ✅ Keep First Line Under 72 Characters
- ✅ Reference Issues / PRs with `#number`
- ✅ Explain **Why** in Body, Not ❌ **What** (Code Shows **What**)
- ✅ Use Body to provide Context
- ✅ Use Footer for Breaking Changes & References

**❌ DON'Ts** :

- ❌ End with Period (.) in Subject Line
- ❌ Use Vague Messages ("Fix Stuff", "Update", "Changes")
- ❌ Include Multiple Unrelated Changes
- ❌ Commit Commented-Out Code
- ❌ Commit `console.log()` / Debug Statements

## Code Standards

### Python (Backend)

**Formatting & Linting** :

- **Formatter** : Black (line length: 88)
- **Linter** : Flake8
- **Import Sorting** : isort
- **Type Hints** : Required for Public APIs
- **Docstrings** : Required for Classes & Public Methods (Google Style)

**Configuration Files** :

- `pyproject.toml` - Black, isort, pytest Configuration
- `.flake8` - Flake8 Rules
- `pytest.ini` - Test Configuration

**Pre-Commit Commands** :

```bash
cd backend

# Auto-Format Code
black .

# Check Linting
flake8

# Sort Imports
isort .

# Type Checking (Optional, If Using mypy)
mypy .

# Run Tests with Coverage
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```

**Code Style** :

```python
"""Module docstring Describing Purpose."""

from typing import Optional, List
from django.db import models


class User(models.Model):
    """User Model for Authentication.

    Attributes :
        email : User's Email Address (Unique)
        username : User's Display Name
        is_active : Account Activation Status
    """

    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    username = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    class Meta:
        db_table = "auth.users"
        ordering = ["-created_at"]

    def get_display_name(self) -> str:
        """Return the User's Display Name.

        Returns :
            Username / Email if username Not Set.
        """
        return self.username or self.email
```

**API Documentation Standards (`drf-yasg`)** :

Due to the removal of internal Sschema Support in `django-filter` 25.x, Automatic Detection of Query Parameters is limited.

- ✅ **Manual Documentation Required** : For any ViewSet using `DjangoFilterBackend`, you must manually define the filter parameters using the `@swagger_auto_schema` Decorator.

- ✅ **Consistency** : Ensure Parameter Names in `@swagger_auto_schema` exactly match the Field Names defined in your `FilterSet`.

**Example Implementation** :

```python
from drf_yasg import openapi
from drf_yasg.utils import swagger_auto_schema

class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
  filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]
  filterset_class = UserFilter

  @swagger_auto_schema(
    manual_parameters=[
      openapi.Parameter(
        'is_active',
        openapi.IN_QUERY,
        description="Filter by active status",
        type=openapi.TYPE_BOOLEAN
      ),
    ]
  )
  def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    return super().list(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

### TypeScript (Frontend / Mobile)

**Configuration** :

- **Linter** : ESLint with Strict Rules
- **Type Checking** : Strict TypeScript Enabled
- **Style Guide** : Airbnb Base (Customized)

**Naming Conventions** :

- `camelCase` - Variables, Functions
- `PascalCase` - Components, Classes, Types
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` - Constants
- `kebab-case` - File Names (Except Components)

**Pre-commit Commands** :

```bash
cd frontend

# Lint Code
npm run lint

# Auto-Fix Linting Issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type Check
npm run type-check

# Run Tests
npm test

# Check Coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

**Component Structure** :

```tsx
// 1. Imports (Grouped)
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { z } from "zod";

// Internal Imports
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";
import { api } from "@/lib/api";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

// 2. Types / Interfaces
interface UserProfileProps {
  userId: string;
  onUpdate?: (user: User) => void;
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// 3. Constants
const MAX_NAME_LENGTH = 100;

// 4. Validation Schemas
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(MAX_NAME_LENGTH),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

// 5. Component
export function UserProfile({ userId, onUpdate }: UserProfileProps) {
  // 6. State
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  // 7. Hooks
  const router = useRouter();

  // 8. Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    loadUser();
  }, [userId]);

  // 9. Handlers
  const loadUser = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      setIsLoading(true);
      const data = await api.getUser(userId);
      setUser(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Failed to Load User");
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, [userId]);

  const handleUpdate = async () => {
    if (!user) return;

    try {
      const updated = await api.updateUser(user.id, user);
      setUser(updated);
      onUpdate?.(updated);
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Failed to Update User");
    }
  };

  // 10. Early Returns
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading ... .. .</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error : {error}</div>;
  if (!user) return <div>User Not Found</div>;

  // 11. Render
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{user.email}</p>
      <Button onClick={handleUpdate}>Update</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### General Code Standards

**For All Code** :

- ✅ Keep Functions Small (< 50 Lines Ideal)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- ✅ Write Self-Documenting Code
- ✅ Comment Complex Logic (Justify "Why", Not ❌ "What")
- ✅ Handle Errors Appropriately
- ✅ No Magic Numbers (Use Constants)
- ✅ Avoid Deep Nesting (< 3 Levels)

**Don'ts** :

- ❌ Commit Commented-Out Code
- ❌ Keep `console.log()` in Production
- ❌ Use `any` Type in TypeScript
- ❌ Ignore Linter Warnings
- ❌ Skip Error Handling
- ❌ Write Tests After the Fact

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Coverage

**Coverage Targets** :

- **Backend** : 80%+ Code Coverage
- **Frontend** : 80%+ Code Coverage
- **UI Components** : 95%+ Coverage
- **Critical Paths** : 100% Coverage

**Current Status** :

- **UI Components** : 99.78% ✅
- **Backend** : Targeting 80%+
- **Frontend** : Targeting 80%+

### Test Types

**Backend Tests** :

```bash
backend/apps/[app]/tests/
├── test_models.py      # Model Tests
├── test_views.py       # API Endpoint Tests
├── test_serializers.py # Serializer Tests
├── test_services.py    # Business Logic Tests
└── factories.py        # Test Data Factories
```

**Frontend Tests** :

```bash
frontend/src/
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx
│       ├── Button.test.tsx       # Unit Tests
│       └── Button.stories.tsx    # Storybook
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAuth.ts
│   └── useAuth.test.ts
└── utils/
    ├── validation.ts
    └── validation.test.ts
```

### Running Tests

**Backend** :

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate

# All Tests
pytest

# With Coverage
pytest --cov --cov-report=html

# Specific File
pytest apps/users/tests/test_models.py

# Specific Test
pytest apps/users/tests/test_models.py::TestUserModel::test_create_user

# Failed Tests Only
pytest --lf

# Verbose Output
pytest -v

# Stop on First Failure
pytest -x
```

**Frontend** :

```bash
cd frontend

# All Tests
npm test

# With Coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Specific File
npm test -- Button.test.tsx

# Watch Mode
npm test -- --watch

# Update Snapshots
npm test -- -u

# Verbose
npm test -- --verbose
```

**Storybook** :

```bash
cd frontend

# Start Storybook
npm run storybook

# Build Storybook
npm run build-storybook
```

### Writing Good Tests

**Test Structure (AAA [Arrange-Act-Assert] Pattern)** :

```python
def test_user_registration():
    # Arrange - Set Up Test Data
    user_data = {
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "password": "SecurePass123!",
        "username": "testuser"
    }

    # Act - Perform the Action
    response = client.post("/api/auth/register", json=user_data)

    # Assert - Verify Results
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["email"] == user_data["email"]
    assert "password" not in response.json()
```

**ReactJS Component Testing** :

```tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Button } from "./Button";

describe("Button", () => {
  it("Calls onClick when Clicked", () => {
    // Arrange
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);

    // Act
    const button = screen.getByText("Click Me");
    fireEvent.click(button);

    // Assert
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });

  it("Disables Button when 'disabled' Property is true", () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Click Me</Button>);

    const button = screen.getByText("Click Me");
    expect(button).toBeDisabled();
  });
});
```

**Best Practices** :

- ✅ Test Behavior, Not Implementation
- ✅ Use Descriptive Test Names
- ✅ One Logical Assertion Per Test
- ✅ Use Factories / Fixtures for Test Data
- ✅ Mock External Dependencies
- ✅ Test Edge Cases & Errors
- ✅ Keep Tests Fast
- ✅ Make Tests Independent

**Don'ts** :

- ❌ Test Framework Code
- ❌ Test 3rd Party Libraries
- ❌ Write Brittle Tests (Too Specific)
- ❌ Skip Error Cases
- ❌ Ignore Failing Tests
- ❌ Test Private Methods Directly

### Testing Standards

- **Coverage** : Maintain at least 80% Test Coverage for new features.
- **Passing** : All Existing Tests must pass before a PR is considered.
- **Environment** : Tests must pass in both Local & CI Environments.
- **Cache Integrity** : Ensure Any Changes to Build Scripts / Dependency Files do not significantly increase the Cache Footprint beyond the 10GB GitHub Limit. 🚀
